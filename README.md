# C++ Basics Demonstration

This repository contains examples and snippets to demonstrate fundamental concepts in C++. It is designed to help beginners understand the basics of C++ programming.

## Features

### 1. Input/Output Operations
- Using `cin` and `cout` for user interaction.
- Examples include reading numbers, displaying results, and formatting output.

### 2. Data Types
- Demonstrations of common data types:
  - `int`, `float`, `char`, `bool`, `double`
- Example: Calculating the ASCII value of a character.

### 3. Control Structures
- **Conditionals**: 
  - `if-else` and `if-else if` blocks for decision-making.
  - Example: Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **Loops**:
  - `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops for iterations.
  - Example: Printing numbers, factorial calculation.

### 4. Functions
- Simple demonstration of user-defined functions:
  - Example: An `add` function that adds two numbers.

### 5. Math Operations
- Examples of basic arithmetic:
  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo.
- Example: Calculate the area of a rectangle.

### 6. Arrays
- Simple traversal and printing of array elements.

### 7. Logical Implementations
- Examples include:
  - Check for odd/even numbers.
  - Reverse a number.
  - Find the largest among three numbers.

### 8. Patterns
- Basic pattern printing using loops:
  - Example: Printing stars in ascending order.

### 9. Character Handling
- Checking if a character is a vowel or consonant.
- Determining if a character is uppercase or lowercase.

### 10. Miscellaneous
- Swapping variables.
- Simple interest calculation.
- Sum of natural numbers.
